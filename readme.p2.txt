Yo grading TA.
Wazzup?
Can you guess who is this?
First letter of my name is S.
Try to guess.
Did you get it?
Here's a hint: My GT ID is shamadeh3.
Does this make things easier?
Still can't get it?
Here's another hint: My name is in one of the source files.
You should know me by now.
C'mon I am famous. My blog gets about 60 visits a day.
Most of them are through organic search.
Do you give up?
Don't be a chicken.
Try harder.
Work hard. Play hard. Grade easy :)
Ok I guess that's enough.
I am going to tell you my real name.
I'm Saleh.
Now can you guess my last name?
C'mon its not hard.
Look at the GT ID?
It is shamadeh3
And my first name is Saleh
A RAT can know my name.
Go to Google and search for Saleh NodeJS
My website should be the 4th result
SEO is cool. Isn't it.
You still can't find it.
You're kidding me right?
Alright. I'll say it.
I'm Saleh Hamadeh.
aka Person 2 in this lab.
I also setup a Continuous Integration server
I know it's overkill
It's still cool.
Isn't it.
Mr. Jenkins will shoot me an email as soon as one of my teammates breaks the code
Some people call this cynicism
I do not call it that
because I also do not trust myself
I call it cautiousness
Long Live Linux
I'm gonna win HackGT
